            <h2>3&#41; Talking about games... will MSC provide any game to its owners </h2>
            <p>

            There is no doubt about it! As we are very aware of the fact that Metaverse is a virtual world, we are more concerned than ever about our lifestyles. Therefore, for those who walk/run/play any game or even move around their own homes inside the space, for at least 30 minutes a day, we are rewarding them with $VILLA tokens. Besides those 35 $VILLA tokens claimable everyday for the holders, there will be an extra 10 $VILLA more for those who are participating in our game called On The Move.

            <h2>4&#41;  What does $VILLA represents</h2>
            <p>
            Utility token that fills our decentralized biological system. There will also be the “Villa Shop” where holders will have the opportunity of utilizing and exchanging their $VILLA to mint their very own 3D house, wearables, basketball court, vehicles, and much more to enhance their Blockchain Gaming experience as we expand throughout the Metaverse!

            <h2>5&#41; From what “Club” comes from?</h2>
            <p>
            The third word, Club, inside MSC, has a very powerful role to play. The Club is an exclusive assembly for members. Whoever owns at least one pair or Meta Sneakers, he is eligible to be part of the Club and he has two free entries inside The Villa every single day!

            <h2>6&#41; What do you mean when you say The Villa?</h2>
            <p>

            The Villa or The Mansion, as we like to call it, is a 6x6 real estate build alongside Sandbox team. Here is the place where private parties, private shows, endless airdrops, many famous artists and MSC team are going to meet and be at. Here will be the only place inside the Metaverse where everyone will discuss billion dollar ideas and put them into work.
